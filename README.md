This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# for development
yarn dev

# for testing
yarn test
yarn test:coverage
```

- To switch between sandbox & local environment, we can configure **MY_ENV** in `next.config.mjs` file.
- Sandbox environment will use data from local json file, while local environment will use api endpoints.
